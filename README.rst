    enabled = true
    musicbox = false
    websocket_host =
    websocket_port =
    on_track_click = PLAY_ALL

The following configuration values are available should you wish to customize your installation further:

- ``musicbox_darkclient/enabled``: If the MMW extension should be enabled or not. Defaults to ``true``.

- ``musicbox_darkclient/musicbox``: Set this to ``true`` if you are connecting to a Mopidy instance running on a
  Pi Musicbox. Expands the MMW user interface to include system control/configuration functionality.

- ``musicbox_darkclient/websocket_host``: Optional setting to specify the target host for Mopidy websocket connections.

- ``musicbox_darkclient/websocket_port``: Optional setting to specify the target port for Mopidy websocket connections.
